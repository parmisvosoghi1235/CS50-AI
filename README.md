#  CS50-AI – CS50 Artificial Intelligence Projects by Parmis Vosoughi Nezhad

This repository contains my personal journey through Harvard's CS50 AI course — a hands-on introduction to the foundational concepts of Artificial Intelligence using Python. Each folder documents weekly projects, challenges, and reflections as I explore search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning, and natural language processing.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repository is organized by week, with each folder containing the relevant assignments and code:

- **Week 0 – Search**  
  Implemented maze-solving agents using Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, and A* algorithms.

- **Week 1 – Knowledge**  
  Built logical inference engines using propositional logic and model checking.

- **Week 2 – Uncertainty**  
  Applied probability theory and Bayesian networks to model uncertain environments.

- **Week 3 – Optimization**  
  Solved constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku and scheduling.

- **Week 4 – Learning**  
  Trained machine learning models for classification tasks using scikit-learn.

- **Week 5 – Neural Networks**  
  Built and trained neural networks using TensorFlow to recognize digits and patterns.

- **Week 6 – Language**  
  Developed NLP tools for topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and question answering.

- **Final Project**  
  A capstone project combining multiple AI techniques to solve a real-world problem.
